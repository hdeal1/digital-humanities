Preface: 

The purpose of this software, developed by Henry Deal, Johnny Lindbergh, and Andy Wood, 
is to aid school history departments in the teaching and comprehension of virtually any 
historical subject through web-based mapping/projection platform. Originally created for our 
high-school's AP European History department -- we realized as we were developing that this 
project would not be scalable with the language and programming style (Node.js and Apache2) 
we were using. Early February 2018, we pivoted to a larger and more feature-full language 
(Java and Tomcat). With this change, we reaped the benefits of an Object Oriented Programming 
style that Java provides. Our project then became more streamlined and a more a structured 
service, evolving in perpetuity from this point.
